# I Got A Budget (IGAB)
Budgeting Web App for Personal Use

I've being user of YNAB (https://www.youneedabudget.com/) to handle my personal budget since 2015 and, since to keep up with my budget is very important to me, there are multiple features that are not available and I know will make my life (and of many users) easier. That's why I decided to create my own version of a budgeting app, keeping the features that I love from YNAB, but adding what I really need to make it stand out.

## Planned Features
- Expense management
- Multicurrency support
- Multiple budget scenarios
- Use percentages and quantities in budget scenarios
- Import data from YNAB
- Use as UI for YNAB
- Financial institution details for bank accounts and credit card
- Import bank online transactions
- Improved reporting
